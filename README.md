# 404 Glitched Out Page

This 404 page is so glitched out that it crashes codepen.io and seriously slows down chrome when running it locally.

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one [here]('https://codepen.io/rob-rychs/pen/YEqNNX'). (it'll probably freeze the window and you might have to kill the process)

I Got the idea from 3 other pens.
I just threw in a bit of my own sense stylin and then went overkill adding in typed.js to print out mock terminal errors on screen.
A lot of CSS3 animations + JS slowing down page.
